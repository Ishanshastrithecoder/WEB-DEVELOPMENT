        <p style="max-width: 900px; margin: auto; font-size: 18px;">
            CHARUSAT was established in 2009 under the Gujarat State Private University Act, but its roots trace back to the visionary effort of Shri Charotar Moti Sattavis Patidar Kelavani Mandalâ€”a not-for-profit trust working in education since 1994. The trust
            was formed by philanthropists and academicians with a strong desire to uplift rural education.
            <br><br> Over the years, CHARUSAT has evolved into a multidisciplinary university that emphasizes academic excellence, innovation, and service to society. It has received approval from the UGC and recognition from various bodies including
            AICTE, PCI, and NIRF.
